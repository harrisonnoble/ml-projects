    "# Lab One: Exploring Table Data\n",

    "\n",
    "According to UCI [Ref 1], this dataset contains \"red and white wine varients of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine\". Two datasets were collected, one for the reds and one for the whites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was gathered via physical/chemical tests (such as acid content) and judgements of the quality. The value for the quality was determined by having three wine testers try each wine and score it from 0 to 10, with 0 being very bad and 10 being excellent. The median of the three scores was used in the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine quality dataset contains 1599 red wine samples and 4898 white wine samples, with 6497 samples in total. There are 12 unique features including the quality value. Each feature is aside from the quality is numerical, with the quality being categorical.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing this dataset, we will be able to help predict which wines should continue to be tested in order to eventually reach the market. If we were to design the algorithm for high quality wine testers, we would only want to send them the samples that are deemed to be a 7 or higher on the quality by the algorithm. In order to accomplish this, we will want to reduce the amount of false-negatives in order to ensure that no top quality wine is passed up on. To this end, some underperforming wines will pass through as false-positives. We accept this tradeoff so long that the algorithm narrows down the samples by 60%, assuming the majority of the wines are rated below 7. This could be useful for wine testers as it cuts down the total amount of samples that would need to be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this dataset could be used to predict how the chemical or physical compenents of the wine correspond to the quality. By exploring the relationship between the features provided and the quality of the wine, we will be able to determine which feature values or ratios correspond to higher qualities. Wine producers would be interested in this result as they could determine which features and how much of them lead to higher quality wines. For this model to work well, we would like to limit the false positive rate so that we ensure that the producers are not given poor predictions.\n",
